# StudentAPI

The goal of the task is to create a server-side REST API web service project on a freely chosen topic:
  * Create a new REST API using an ASP.NET 6 Core Web minimal API or another type of typical (MVC) project using controllers. 
  * Store and display data from the created service API using a SQL database such as Postgres, MySQL, MSSQL, etc. You can use an ORM framework such as Entity framework       or another one that is more convenient for working with database data.
